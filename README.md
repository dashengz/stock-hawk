Project StockHawk is based on an existing app created by Sam Chordas.
Improvements and functionality implementation are carried out by me.

### Key Features:
- **Widget:** The app now has a collection widget that can show stock information on the homescreen,
and update periodically and go to the corresponding stock after onClick.

- **User-friendly Alerts:** When there's no valid network connection,
the app will notify the user instead of displaying a blank screen or throwing an exception:

- **RTL Support:** The app adds RTL support for users in need and take into consideration different locale formats:

- **Line Charts:** The app shows detail information of a stock once the user clicks on the item.
It displays the changes of the stock price of the last seven days in a line chart,
and the user can click on the data points to see details of each day.

- **Accessible:** The app provides content description for all the buttons, charts and data points.
The user can easily use Talkback to have the description read out loud.
